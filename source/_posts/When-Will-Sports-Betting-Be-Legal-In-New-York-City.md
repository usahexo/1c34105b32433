#  When Will Sports Betting Be Legal In New York City?

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a tweet that he is seeking to legalize sports betting in the city before the end of the year.

The move would come as a surprise to some, as sports betting is currently illegal in New York state.

``I'm confident we can get something done this year,'' de Blasio said Wednesday on Twitter. ``This is an issue of fairness and there's no reason we shouldn't have it here.''

Legalizing sports betting in New York City is seen as a way to generate additional tax revenue. The state has already legalized online sports betting, but has not yet authorized any brick-and-mortar casinos.

Gaming industry leaders and lawmakers are pushing for the legalization of full-scale casino gambling in the state, which they say would bring in much more revenue than just legalizing sports betting. However, that proposal faces strong opposition from many quarters, including Native American tribes with casino interests.

It's unclear how quickly lawmakers might act on the mayor's proposal to legalize sports betting in New York City.

#  New York May Finally Legalize Sports Betting

After decades of unsuccessfully trying to legalize sports betting in New York, lawmakers are optimistic that the tide may finally be turning. A recent report by the state's Gaming Commission has concluded that sports betting could be a major boon to the state's economy, generating up to $677 million in annual revenue.

This is good news for New Yorkers, who are currently limited to placing bets on offshore websites. Not only are these bets illegal, but they also come with a host of associated risks, including the potential for fraud and identity theft.

Legalizing sports betting would not only provide a safe and legal alternative, but it would also allow New York to collect taxes on these wagers. This could generate millions of dollars in much-needed revenue for the state.

Lawmakers are now working on a bill that would legalize sports betting in New York. The bill is still being drafted, so there are many details yet to be determined, such as how much tax revenue would be generated and which sports would be allowed to be bet on.

But if things go according to plan, New Yorkers could soon be able to legally place bets on their favorite teams at local casinos and racetracks. This would make New York one of the few states with legalized sports betting, joining Nevada, Delaware, and Oregon.

#  When Will New York Catch Up To Other States With Legal Sports Betting?

If you take a look at the current state of sports betting in the United States, you will see that there are a number of states that have already legalized it. This is in contrast to New York, which has not yet legalized sports betting. There are a few reasons for this, but many people believe that New York will legalize sports betting in the near future.

One of the main reasons why New York has not yet legalized sports betting is because the state is still waiting on a decision from the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is currently considering the legality of sports betting, and they are expected to make a decision in the near future. Once they make their decision, it is likely that New York will legalize sports betting in order to keep up with other states.

Another reason why New York has not yet legalized sports betting is because there is some disagreement among lawmakers about how it should be regulated. Some people believe that the state should allow casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting, while others believe that it should be limited to online gambling sites. There is still some disagreement about how it should be regulated, but it is likely that this will be resolved in the near future.

Overall, there are a number of reasons why New York has not yet legalized sports betting. However, most people believe that this will change in the near future, especially now that the Supreme Court is considering the legality of sports betting. Once they make their decision, it is likely that New York will legalize sports betting in order to keep up with other states.

#  What's The Timeline For Legalized Sports Gambling In New York City?

After years of debate and discussion, the legalization of sports gambling in New York City is now a reality. The law was passed by the state legislature in June and signed into law by Governor Andrew Cuomo. But what is the timeline for when betting can actually start?

The short answer is that it depends on how quickly the New York State Gaming Commission can implement the regulations needed to make sports gambling legal. Commission chairman Karl Ben Ezra estimates that it could take six to eight months to get everything in place.

Once the regulations are finalized, there will likely be a brief testing period before sports betting is officially open for business. So we could be looking at sometime around early 2019 before people in New York City can legally bet on sports.

Until then, we'll just have to keep watching and waiting.

#  New York City Continues To Debate legality Of Sports Gambling

Following the repeal of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) by the United States Supreme Court in May, several states have begun to legalize sports gambling. This has caused much debate in New York City, where lawmakers are still trying to decide whether or not to legalize sports gambling.

On one side of the argument, supporters of legalizing sports gambling claim that it would be a major boon for the city’s economy. They argue that it would create new jobs and bring in much-needed revenue to the city. In addition, they claim that legalized sports gambling would protect consumers from fraud and provide a safe and regulated environment for them to gamble in.

On the other side of the argument, opponents of legalizing sports gambling argue that it could lead to an increase in crime and addiction rates. They also argue that it would be bad for the city’s economy, as it would lead to an increase in spending on gambling instead of more productive activities.

So far, there has been no consensus among New York City lawmakers on how to proceed with legalizing sports gambling. Some officials are in favor of it, while others are opposed outright. It remains to be seen whether or not New York City will eventually legalize sports gambling, but the debate is sure to continue for some time.
