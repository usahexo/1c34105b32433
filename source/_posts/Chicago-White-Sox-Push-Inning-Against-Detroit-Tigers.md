#  Chicago White Sox Push Inning Against Detroit Tigers

The Chicago White Sox were looking to extend their lead in the bottom of the seventh inning against the Detroit Tigers on Wednesday night. They had a 2-0 advantage and starter James Shields was cruising along.

Shields got the first two batters out before he allowed a single to Nicholas Castellanos. With runners on first and second, Justin Upton hit a grounder to shortstop Tim Anderson. Upton beat the throw to first base, but Castellanos was cut down at home plate by catcher Omar Narvaez.

That ended the inning, but it gave the White Sox an important insurance run. In the end, they won 3-0 to move into first place in the American League Central Division.

The Tigers have now lost six straight games and are in last place in the division.

The White Sox got off to a strong start, scoring two runs in the first inning. They then added another run in the third inning, putting them up 3-0. However, the Indians made a comeback in the bottom of the fifth inning, scoring two runs to make it 3-2.

In the top of the ninth inning, Jose Abreu came up with two runners on base and hit a double to bring them both home, giving the White Sox a 4-3 lead. The Cleveland Indians were unable to score in their last at-bat, giving the Chicago White Sox a victory.

This was an important win for the Chicago White Sox as they continue their push for a playoff spot. They are now just one game behind the Cleveland Indians for first place in the AL Central Division. Up next for them is another matchup against the Cleveland Indians on July 10th.

The Sox will now travel to Cleveland for a three-game series against the Indians.

#  Chicago White Sox Look To Continue Winning Ways Against Milwaukee Brewers

The Chicago White Sox will be looking to continue their winning ways on Tuesday night when they take on the Milwaukee Brewers at Guaranteed Rate Field.

The Brewers will counter with Junior Guerra, who is 4-3 with a 2.89 ERA this season.

#  Chicago White Sox Headed In Right Direction, Pushing Towards Playoffs

The Chicago White Sox have been a hot topic in the MLB offseason. Many believe that they are heading in the right direction and will be a playoff team this upcoming season.

There were many big moves made by the White Sox this offseason. They acquired Edwin Encarnacion from the Cleveland Indians, and Nathan Eovaldi from the Boston Red Sox.

These two additions make a very potent lineup for the White Sox. They now have one of the best lineups in all of baseball. It starts with Jose Abreu at first base, followed by Yoan Moncada at second base. Then you have Tim Anderson at shortstop, and finally, you have Encarnacion and Eovaldi batting fourth and fifth in the lineup.

This lineup is going to score a lot of runs this season. The bullpen has also been upgraded, with the addition of Kelvin Herrera from the Kansas City Royals. This gives the White Sox one of the deepest bullpens in all of baseball.

The biggest question mark for the White Sox is their starting rotation. Carlos Rodon is their ace, but after that, it is a bit of a toss-up who will be in their starting rotation on Opening Day.

I believe that the White Sox rotation will eventually settle into place and they will be a playoff team this season. They are heading in the right direction and are poised to make a run at the World Series this year.
