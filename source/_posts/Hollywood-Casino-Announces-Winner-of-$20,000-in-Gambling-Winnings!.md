#  Hollywood Casino Reports Record-Breaking Gambling Losses in March!

The Hollywood Casino in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, reported record-breaking gambling losses in March. According to casino officials, the $22.6 million in losses was a 36 percent increase from the same period last year.

The casino attributed the high losses to the new state law that allows for table games such as blackjack and roulette. Officials say that the increased competition from casinos in other states is also a contributing factor.

The Hollywood Casino has already laid off eighty-eight employees, and additional layoffs are expected in the coming months. The casino has also announced plans to close its poker room and reduce its hours of operation.

This is just the latest bad news for the Hollywood Casino, which has been struggling since it opened in 2012. In February, the casino defaulted on a $47 million loan payment.

Indiana gambling officials are hopeful that the new law will help to revive the faltering industry, but so far it appears that it is only having a negative impact.

#  Hollywood Casino Reports Steady Gambling Winnings and Losses over Past Year

The Hollywood Casino in Pennsylvania has released their annual report of gambling winnings and losses for the past year. The casino reports that they had a total of $265 million in gambling revenue, with $228 million coming from slot machines and $37 million from table games. This is a slight increase from the previous year, where they had total gambling revenue of $260 million.

However, while Hollywood Casino saw an increase in revenue overall, their net income still decreased by $3 million from the previous year. This is primarily due to an increase in operating costs and interest payments. In particular, the casino’s marketing expenses more than doubled from $6 million to $15 million.

Despite these costs, Hollywood Casino seems to be doing well overall. Their operating income increased by over $5 million, and they managed to maintain a steady customer base. Furthermore, the casino has shown no signs of slowing down – in fact, their table game revenues continue to grow each year.

So if you’re looking for a good place to gamble in Pennsylvania, Hollywood Casino is definitely worth considering. They may not have the cheapest games in town, but you can be sure that you’ll get a quality experience here.
