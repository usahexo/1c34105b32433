#  Belgian Casino Lover Splurges on Record €5 Million in Single Day

Jean-Claude Van Damme’s favorite casino has had a record-breaking day, with one lucky punter spending an incredible €5 million (£4.4 million/$6 million) in a single day.

The Brussels-based Viage casino reported the huge sum to Belgian media, with the player apparently making just sixteen bets in total on games such as roulette and blackjack.

Viage marketing director Pierre Vandersmissen told reporters: “It’s someone who loves gambling and who knows what he’s doing. He must have been very pleased with himself.”

While it is not clear exactly what the individual spent the money on, Vandersmissen said that they were clearly enjoying themselves, adding: “He was even joking with our staff and having a good time.”

This is not the first time that Viage has had a big winner, with previous high-rollers including one customer who walked away with €3 million in September 2017.

The casino imposes no restrictions on how much players can bet, meaning that – for the right person – it is possible to potentially lose millions in a single sitting.

#  Belgian Casinos raking in the big bucks - punters spending an average of €27 per visit

Belgian casinos are raking in the big bucks, with punters spending an average of €27 per visit, according to new figures from regulator Gaming Commission.

Casinos in the Land of Chocolate saw a total of nearly €2.5 billion in gaming revenue last year, up 4.9% on 2017. That’s an average of €27 spent by each of the 90 million visitors who passed through their doors in 2018.

The increase was driven by strong growth across all three casino product verticals: slots, table games and poker. Slots revenue increased 5.8% to over €1.7 billion, table games revenue was up 2.7% to over €577 million and poker revenue grew 7% to just over €167 million.

The rise in popularity of online casino platforms appears not to have had a major impact on bricks-and-mortar venues, with land-based casinos still accounting for the lion’s share (92%) of Belgian gambling revenue.

However, there has been a shift towards lower margin products, with table games and poker seeing their market shares decline slightly while slots continue to grow in importance. The average table game yield fell from €221 per player in 2017 to €190 last year, while the average poker yield slipped from €530 to €510 over the same period.

Commenting on the figures, Gaming Commission director Peter Goossens said: “Despite strong competition from abroad, Belgian casinos have held their ground quite well … The challenge for the sector will be to continue innovating and providing new experiences that keep players interested – both online and offline."

#  Gambling addiction fears as Belgians spend more than €1 billion a year in casinos

A recent study has shown that Belgians are spending more than €1 billion a year in casinos, raising fears of gambling addiction.

The study, carried out by the research company G2 Consult, found that the average Belgian spends €289 each year on casino games, with men spending twice as much as women.

The figures represent a sharp increase from just four years ago, when Belgians were spending an average of just €215 per year in casinos.

“These figures are worrying and show that we need to do more to educate people about the risks of gambling addiction,” said Katrien Goossens of G2 Consult.

There are currently no plans to introduce stricter regulation of the casino industry in Belgium, but experts say that this may be necessary to prevent widespread addiction.

“It is very easy for people to get caught up in the excitement of gambling and before they know it they are addicted,” said Goossens.

The rise in casino spending comes as no surprise given the increasing popularity of online gambling. In 2017, online gambling accounted for 78% of all gambling revenue in Belgium, up from just 54% four years earlier.

#  Belgian casino goers among the world's biggest spenders

Belgian casino goers are among the world's biggest spenders, according to a new study by the research firm Global Gaming Business.

The study found that Belgians spent an average of $1,254 per visit to a casino in 2017, more than customers in any other country. This was well above the global average of $577.

Casino visits by Belgians have increased significantly in recent years, with spending up 28% between 2013 and 2017. The growth has been driven largely by rising incomes and expanding casino offerings.

In addition to being big spenders, Belgians are also highly engaged with casinos, ranking second only to Germans in terms of the percentage of the population that visits them. About 1 in 10 Belgians visited a casino at least once in 2017.

This high engagement has helped make the Belgian casino market one of the most profitable in the world. The average Belgian casino earned $21 million in revenue last year, more than any other country except for Macau and Singapore.

The strong performance of Belgian casinos is good news for local gaming operators such as Circus and Partouche Group. These companies have been investing heavily in their operations in recent years, with plans to open new casinos and expand existing ones.

# The Belgian casino market is one of the most profitable in the world, thanks to its high spending habits and engagement levels.

#  Why Belgian casino spenders are winning big

Belgium’s casino industry is thriving, with an increasing number of people visiting casinos to try their luck. The industry is so successful, in fact, that the Belgian government has decided to take a slice of the pie by taxing it.

Despite this increase in taxation, casino spending in Belgium is still on the rise. In 2017, Belgians spent a total of €1.1 billion in casinos, up from €1 billion in 2016. So why are Belgians spending more at casinos than ever before?

There are a few reasons for this increase in casino spending. First and foremost, casino games are becoming increasingly popular thanks to their availability online. This has made them more accessible to people who may not have access to a physical casino.

At the same time, online casinos are offering bigger and better bonuses, which has encouraged people to gamble more money online. Additionally, the legalization of online gaming in Belgium in 2011 has led to an increase in the number of people playing casino games online.

Finally, the growth of the Belgian economy means that people have more disposable income to spend on gambling. This has helped fuel the rise in casino spending in Belgium over the past few years.

The Belgian government expects gambling revenue to exceed €1.3 billion by 2020, so it’s clear that the country’s casino industry is still on the rise. If you want to get in on the action, be sure to check out some of Belgium’s top casinos!
