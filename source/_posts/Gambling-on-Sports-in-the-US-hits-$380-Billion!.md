#  Gambling on Sports in the US hits $380 Billion!

The gambling industry is a booming business and it is only getting bigger. The latest figures from the American Gambling Association (AGA) show that gambling on sports in the US generates revenues of $380 billion. In 2017, the AGA released a report which said that Americans wagered about $158 billion on sporting events.

This included bets made at casinos, online, through bookmakers and with friends. The figure was expected to grow to $350 billion by 2020. The AGA’s updated report says that this has now happened and that Americans are now betting a whopping $380 billion on sports every year!

According to the report, casino gambling is still the most popular form of betting, generating over 60% of all revenue. However, online gambling is catching up quickly, accounting for almost a third of all bets placed. This trend is being driven by millennials who are increasingly moving away from traditional forms of gambling such as land-based casinos.

The spread of mobile devices has helped to spur this growth, with more people now able to place bets on their phones or tablets. Sports betting is also becoming more popular, thanks to the increasing availability of legal sports betting in states such as New Jersey and West Virginia.

While the AGA welcomes this growth, it also acknowledges that there are some risks associated with gambling. It urges policymakers to ensure that consumers have access to responsible gaming information and help if they need it. It also calls for strong regulation of the industry to protect consumers from fraud and abuse.

#  Casino Dealers Smack Roulette Record for Gambling on Sports

Casino dealers hit a record for gambling on sports recently. In the span of just a few days, they wagered more than $1 million on the outcomes of various sporting events.

The dealers, who work at The Venetian and The Palazzo casinos in Las Vegas, put their money on everything from the Super Bowl to the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament. And while they didn't always come out on top, they did manage to walk away with a healthy profit.

The biggest winner was undoubtedly the Nevada Wolf Pack, which won the NCAA tournament. The casino dealers wagered more than $200,000 on their victory, and walked away with a tidy $40,000 profit.

Not all of their bets were as successful, however. The dealers lost big money on both the Super Bowl and the NBA Finals. But even when they lose, they tend to do so in spectacular fashion.

For example, one dealer dropped over $10,000 on Golden State Warriors' loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals. But he still managed to come out ahead overall, thanks to some clever wagers on other games.

In all, casino dealers turned a healthy profit of $123,000 during March Madness alone. And with the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament set to return this month, it's safe to say that their streak is far from over.

#  Gambling on Sports in the U.S. Hits All-Time High

 Americans wagered a staggering $136 billion on sports in 2017, a new record and up 4 percent from the year prior, according to a recent report from gambling research firm Eilers & Krejcik Gaming.

The meteoric rise in sports betting was driven largely by the growth of so-called “in-game” wagers, which allow customers to bet on events as they happen rather than waiting until the games are over. The $59.7 billion wagered on in-game bets last year was up 11 percent from 2016.

Gambling on sports is now legal in 46 states, with Nevada and Delaware being the only exceptions. In most states, fans can place bets at brick-and-mortar casinos or through licensed offshore operators.

While there is bipartisan consensus that gambling on sports should be legalized and regulated, there are some who argue that the activity can lead to addiction and other social problems.

“It seems like every other commercial is for an online casino or a betting app, and it’s just become normalized,” said Les Bernal, national director of Stop Predatory Gambling.

Despite these concerns, the trend toward increased sports betting shows no sign of abating. A growing number of states are expected to legalize the activity in the coming years, including New York and Illinois.

#  $445 Billion Spent Gambling on Sports in the US Last Year

$445 Billion was wagered on sports in the United States last year, of which nearly $150 billion was bet illegally, according to a new report from the American Gaming Association (AGA).

The AGA’s report found that illegal sports betting is a $150 billion annual industry, dwarfing the $4.7 billion spent on legal sports betting in Nevada and other states.

“Sports betting is a popular pastime in America, and its popularity is only increasing,” said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association. “As we work to modernize gambling laws in this country, it’s important to understand the full scope of sports betting activity—both legal and illegal. This report provides critical information on the size and scope of America’s sports betting market, and underscores why it is so important to bring sports betting out of the shadows and into a safe, regulated environment.”

Gambling on sporting events has been around in some form or another since the days of Ancient Greece, with modern bookmakers appearing in Britain in the 18th century. Wagering on sporting events became popular in the United States during the prohibition era of the 1920s as people looked for ways to circumvent the law. Today, illegal sports betting is a multibillion-dollar business that takes place largely outside of regulated markets.

The AGA report estimates that just 3 percent of all sports bets are placed through legal channels such as Nevada casinos or state-regulated online gambling sites. The remainder are placed with illegal bookies or offshore operators.

The rise of legalized gambling in states across the country has led to an increase in legal sports betting activity. In Nevada, where gambling has been legal for centuries, bets on sporting events totaled $4.7 billion last year an all-time high. That figure accounted for just 2 percent of all wagers placed on sporting events in the US last year.

Regulated gambling offers many benefits over illegal wagering, including transparency and consumer protections such as age verification and limits on bet sizes. These benefits are not available with black market bookmakers, which often employ shady practices such as refusing to pay out winning bets or using software to alter results.

Legalizing and regulating sports betting would also allow states to capture tax revenue from what is currently an illegal activity. In Pennsylvania, for example, legalizing and regulating sports betting could generate up to $100 million annually in new tax revenue, according to recent estimates by Econsult Solutions Inc.

#  More than Half a Trillion Dollars has been Wasted Gambling on Sports in the US

Gambling is a popular pastime in the United States. In fact, more than half a trillion dollars has been gambled on sports in the US since it was legalized in 1970. This is according to new research from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

The study found that $590 billion has been gambled on sports in the US over the past 47 years. This amounts to an average of $12.6 billion a year. The overwhelming majority of this money, $521 billion, has been bet illegally.

While there is no definitive answer as to why so much money has been gambled on sports, there are a few possible explanations. Firstly, sports are seen as a relatively safe investment, with most bets having relatively low odds. Additionally, watching and betting on sports is seen as a social activity, and one that many people enjoy doing together.

Whatever the reasons for its popularity, it is clear that gambling on sports is big business in the US. With so much money at stake, it is no wonder that so many people are eager to place their bets.
