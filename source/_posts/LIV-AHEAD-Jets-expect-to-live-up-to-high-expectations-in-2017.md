#  LIV AHEAD: Jets expect to live up to high expectations in 2017

_It was just a typical offseason for the New York Jets. They made some big-name signings in free agency, including cornerback Morris Claiborne, linebacker Demario Davis and running back Matt Forte. They also used their first-round draft pick on safety Jamal Adams._

Now the Jets are looking to live up to expectations in 2017.

"We have a lot of high expectations this year," said quarterback Josh McCown. "We're excited about what we can do."

The Jets are coming off a 5-11 season, but they believe they can make a run at the playoffs this year.

"There's a lot of talent on this team," said wide receiver Brandon Marshall. "We just need to put it all together."

The Jets will get their first test of the season on Sunday when they take on the Buffalo Bills.

#  LIVING ON THE EDGE: Jets take a gamble on 2017 season

The New York Jets have been a team in turmoil for the past few years. A combination of poor quarterback play, off-the-field drama, and roster mismanagement has led to the Jets becoming one of the laughingstocks of the NFL. This offseason, they decided to take a gamble and make a big bet on the 2017 season.

First and foremost, they made a huge investment in their quarterback position by trading for former Buffalo Bills starter Tyrod Taylor. In addition to Taylor, they also signed veteran backup Josh McCown and drafted highly touted prospect Christian Hackenberg in the second round of the draft. The hope is that one of these three quarterbacks can provide some stability and lead the Jets back to respectability.

Another big move by the Jets was their decision to release wide receiver Brandon Marshall and defensive end Sheldon Richardson. Marshall had become a locker room cancer and was not happy with his role on the team, while Richardson had become too much of a distraction with his off-the-field issues. Releasing both players freed up over $20 million in cap space which they then used to sign players like running back Matt Forte, wide receiver Terrelle Pryor, and cornerback Morris Claiborne.

So far this offseason, it appears that the Jets have taken a step in the right direction. They are still a long way from being competitive, but at least there is now some hope for the future. If Tyrod Taylor can play well and avoid controversy, if Christian Hackenberg can develop into a legitimate starter, and if Todd Bowles can get his team to play together as a unit, then maybe there is still something to play for in New York this year.

#  LIVING FOR TODAY: Jets ready to make a playoff push in 2017

The Jets enter the 2017 NFL season with a new sense of optimism. After finishing 5-11 last season, the Jets cleaned house and replaced head coach Todd Bowles with former Dolphins coach Adam Gase.

The biggest change for the Jets this season is at quarterback, where they will start rookie Sam Darnold. Darnold was the third overall pick in the draft and is expected to be the future of the Jets franchise.

Despite their lack of experience, the Jets are ready to make a playoff push in 2017. Here are three reasons why:

1) The defense is young and improved

The Jets defense was one of the worst in the NFL last season, but it is young and has improved this offseason. The addition of Avery Williamson and Trumaine Johnson should help solidify the defense.

2) The offensive weapons are improving

The Jets offense was also one of the worst in the NFL last season, but it has improved this offseason. The addition of Terrelle Pryor should help stretch the field and give Sam Darnold a big target to throw to.

3) The schedule is favorable

The Jets have a fairly easy schedule this season. They play two games against each of their division rivals (the Bills, Dolphins, and Patriots), and they also have matchups against teams like the Browns and Colts that they should be able to win.

#  LETS GET LIVING: How the Jets can surprise everyone this season

The Jets have not had the best of luck in the past few seasons, but this year they could really turn things around. Here are three ways they can surprise everyone:

1. The offense will be better with quarterback Sam Darnold

Darnold was drafted third overall in the 2018 NFL Draft and many people are expecting big things from him this season. He has already shown his potential in preseason games, so the Jets offense is likely to improve this season.

2. Improved defense with new players

The Jets defense has also been revamped with some new players this season. These players include linebacker Avery Williamson and cornerback Trumaine Johnson, who are both experienced and should help improve the defence.

3. Special teams will be a strength

The Jets special teams unit was strong last year and is likely to be even stronger this season. This includes kicker Jason Myers, who was the AFC Special Teams Player of the Month for August 2018.

All in all, the Jets have a lot of potential this season and could surprise everyone by making it to the playoffs.

#  LIVING ON BORROWED TIME: Will the Jets' luck run out in 2017?

The New York Jets have been one of the NFL's most surprising teams over the past two seasons, thanks in large part to a lot of good fortune. Can they keep it up in 2017?

In 2015, the Jets went 10-6 despite being outscored by 77 points on the season. They were able to win close games and take advantage of other teams' misfortunes, and their luck ran out in the playoffs when they lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Last year, the Jets were even more fortunate, winning five games by a single touchdown or less. They had an average margin of victory of just 2.8 points per game, the second-lowest total in the league. And once again, their luck ran out in the playoffs as they were blown out by the Andrew Luck-led Indianapolis Colts.

This year, things may not be so lucky for Todd Bowles' team. The Jets have overhauled their roster this offseason, losing key contributors such as Nick Mangold, Brandon Marshall and Darrelle Revis. They've also added some talented players such as Morris Claiborne and Kelvin Beachum, but it's unclear if that will be enough to make them a playoff contender.

In order to make the playoffs this year, the Jets will likely need to rely on their luck once again. And while they may have some success early in the season, their luck is likely to run out at some point and they'll miss the playoffs for a third consecutive year.
