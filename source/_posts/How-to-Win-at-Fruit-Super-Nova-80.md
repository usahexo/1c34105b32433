#  How to Win at Fruit Super Nova 80

Fruit Super Nova 80 is an extremely popular arcade game that can be found in many amusement arcades. The premise of the game is to shoot balls at a cluster of fruit in order to make matches and remove them from the screen. The more fruit you remove at once, the more points you earn. If the ball goes off the screen or if you let too many fruits pile up, the game is over.

Here are some tips to help you rack up points and achieve high scores in Fruit Super Nova 80:

1. Shoot quickly and aim for clusters of fruit.

If you take your time to aim for each fruit, you will lose valuable time and the fruits will pile up quickly. It’s better to just fire off shots rapidly and cluster as many fruits together as possible. This will maximize your points and minimize the amount of balls that go off-screen.

2. Know your power-ups.

There are three different power-ups in Fruit Super Nova 80: bomb, fireball, and multi-ball. The bomb destroys all fruit within its radius, the fireball zooms towards its target and explodes upon impact, and the multi-ball splits your ball into three separate balls that can hit more targets simultaneously. Use these power-ups wisely to rack up even more points.

3. Stay on the sidelines if possible.

The further away you are from the playing field, the less likely it is for your balls to go off-screen. If you can stay on the sidelines and only come into play when there are clusters of fruit available, you’ll be able to score more points without having to worry about losing balls unnecessarily.
