#  Toronto Raptors Play Negative, Lose to Houston Rockets

The Toronto Raptors played a negative game on January 5th against the Houston Rockets and lost 103-91. The Raptors couldn’t capitalize on their home court advantage and were streaky offensively. Kyle Lowry led the team in scoring with 20 points, but Serge Ibaka and DeMar Derozan had particularly poor shooting games.

Houston played a strong defensive game, holding Toronto to just 41% shooting from the field. They were able to force 18 turnovers, which led to 21 points for the Rockets. Despite the loss, there were some positives for the Raptors. Jakob Poeltl had another strong game off of the bench, scoring 14 points on 6-8 shooting, and also grabbing seven rebounds.

Toronto will need to improve their play if they want to make it past the first round of the playoffs this year. They have now fallen to third place in the Eastern Conference behind the Boston Celtics and Cleveland Cavaliers.

#  Toronto Raptors Struggle in First Half, Fall to Utah Jazz

TORONTO, ON - The Toronto Raptors were looking to get back in the win column after their loss against the Golden State Warriors, but they had a tough matchup against the Utah Jazz.

The Jazz took an early lead and never looked back, winning the game 112-101. The Raptors struggled offensively in the first half, and couldn't keep up with Utah's shooting.

"We just didn't have it tonight," said Raptors guard Kyle Lowry. "Their defense was really good and we just couldn't get going."

Lowry led the Raptors with 21 points, but no other player scored more than 15. DeMar DeRozan had an off night, scoring only 10 points on 4-of-16 shooting.

The Jazz were led by rookie Donovan Mitchell, who scored 26 points on 11-of-21 shooting. Rudy Gobert added 17 points and 16 rebounds for Utah.

"They're a tough team," said Gobert. "They have a lot of talent and they're well coached. We knew it would be a tough game."

The Raptors will look to bounce back when they host the Miami Heat on Wednesday night.

#  Toronto Raptors Slip by Cleveland Cavaliers with Last Minute Comeback

TORONTO, ON - In a nail biter game that came down to the wire, the Toronto Raptors managed to pull out a victory against the Cleveland Cavaliers with a last minute comeback.

The first half of the game was all Cavs, as they managed to take an early lead and keep it throughout the half. LeBron James was particularly impressive, scoring 24 points in the first half alone. The Raptors were struggling to keep up, managing only 38 points by halftime.

The tide turned in the second half, as Toronto's DeMar DeRozan started to heat up. He scored 14 points in the third quarter, including a buzzer beater at the end of the period that tied up the game at 73.

In the fourth quarter, things stayed close until Kyle Lowry hit a three pointer with just over two minutes left on the clock that put Toronto up by 5. Cleveland fought back and tied up the game again with seconds remaining. But DeRozan was not done yet. With only 9 seconds left on the clock, he hit another three pointer that gave Toronto the win 104-101.

It was a thrilling game for fans of both teams, and showed that both squads have what it takes to make it to this year's NBA Finals.

#  Second Half Surge not Enough as Toronto Raptors Lose to Portland Trail Blazers

The Toronto Raptors looked to be in control of their game against the Portland Trail Blazers with a commanding second half lead. However, some hot shooting from Portland led to a 108-105 Blazers victory.

Kawhi Leonard led Toronto (44-19) with 33 points and 12 rebounds, while Pascal Siakam scored 21 points. Serge Ibaka had his best game in over a month, scoring 15 points and grabbing 14 rebounds.

However, the Raptors were outscored 34-25 in the fourth quarter, as the Blazers (33-31) hit nine three pointers in the game. CJ McCollum led all scorers with 36 points for Portland.

Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts was pleased with the overall effort: “I thought it was a good team win. We had a lot of guys contribute. Our defence was better in the second half and that’s what helped get us back into the game.”

The loss snaps Toronto’s eight game winning streak and drops them to second place in the Eastern Conference, one games behind Milwaukee Bucks (45-18). The Raptors have now lost six of their last ten games.

#  Another Disappointing Loss for Toronto Raptors as They Struggle Against Charlotte Hornets

The Toronto Raptors continue to disappoint their fans this season with another defeat, this time against the Charlotte Hornets. It was clear from the beginning of the game that the Raptors were not on their game, as they allowed the Hornets to take an early lead and never recovered. This was especially frustrating for the fans as it was a home game, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to be optimistic about the team's future.

In addition to the poor performance on the court, there were also several controversies surrounding the team in recent weeks. Most notably, there have been reports of tension between players and head coach Dwane Casey. The team's poor play certainly isn't helping to ease these tensions, and it remains to be seen whether they will be able to turn things around before the end of the season.

Regardless of what happens in the rest of the season, this loss is likely to further frustrate Raptors fans who are already disappointed with how things have gone so far. Many had high expectations for this team going into the year, but they have yet to live up to those expectations. Hopefully they can start turning things around in the coming weeks and give their supporters something to cheer about.
