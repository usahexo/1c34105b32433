#  Vietnam Vet Tells Russian Roulette Story: I Could Feel the Bullet Whiz by My Ear

I was a young, naive kid when I joined the Army in 1966. After basic training, I was sent to Vietnam, where I became a part of the 4th Infantry Division.

Our unit was stationed in the Central Highlands, and we were involved in a lot of fighting. In early 1967, my platoon was sent on a mission to search for enemy troops. We were moving through a dense jungle when we came under fire from an unseen enemy.

I was one of the last soldiers to cross a small stream, and as I did, I heard someone shout "Roulette!" I turned around just in time to see a bullet fly past my head. If I had been a second slower in crossing the stream, I would have been hit.

I could feel the wind from the bullet as it passed by my ear, and I was terrified. It was only later that I learned that "roulette" is Vietnam-speak for Russian roulette. Some of the guys would take turns pointing their guns at each other's heads and pulling the triggers, gambling on whether they would live or die.

Thankfully, I wasn't hit that day and returned safely to my unit. But I'll never forget that close call – it's something that stays with you forever.

#  I Was Lucky I Didn't Die: Vietnam Soldier's Russian Roulette Story

I was 18 years old, a newly-minted United States Army private and about to board a military transport plane for southern Vietnam. It would be my first time flying on an airplane.

The plane ride was uneventful and I found myself in the middle of a raging battlefield within days. Fighting was taking place on three sides of us and we were constantly being shelled with mortars and rocket propelled grenades (RPGs).

On one particular day, I was part of a four-man machine gun team positioned on the edge of a rice paddy. We were firing at the enemy who were entrenched in a nearby tree line. Suddenly, I heard the "whoosh" of an RPG coming in our direction. I dove for cover behind my machine gun as the RPG exploded just a few feet away from us, blasting dirt and shrapnel into my face and body.

Miraculously, I wasn't seriously injured. But later that same day, another soldier in my platoon was not so lucky. He was hit by an RPG and killed instantly.

As bad as things were in Vietnam, they could have been much worse. Like millions of other American soldiers who served in Vietnam, I was lucky to have survived with my life intact.

But it wasn't just luck that saved me – it was also Russian Roulette.

You've probably heard the expression "Russian Roulette", but do you know what it actually is? Russian Roulette is a game where players take turns pointing a gun at their heads and pulling the trigger, chambering only one bullet. The goal is to survive multiple rounds without getting shot.


When I first arrived in Vietnam, I quickly learned about Russian Roulette – there was no avoiding it. It seemed like every other soldier was playing it, often betting cigarettes or other items of value on each round. Many times it resulted in death or serious injury. But because I was lucky enough to survive those first few rounds, I kept playing – and eventually became quite good at it.

Looking back now, I realize how crazy it was for me to be playing Russian Roulette in the middle of a war zone. But at the time, it seemed like nothing could kill me – not enemy fire nor disease nor even land mines (which claimed the lives of many of my friends). In some ways, Russian Roulette offered me a false sense of security and control in an otherwise chaotic and dangerous environment.

It's amazing how quickly your perspective can change while playing Russian Roulette – from feeling invincible one moment to fearing for your life the next. On more than one occasion, I came very close to getting shot – but miraculously managed to survive until the next round.
In the end, my stint in Vietnam ended up lasting only 8 months before I was shipped home wounded – yet still alive. And though I've long since stopped playing Russian Roulette, the memories from that time still linger with me more than 40 years later…

#  Vietnam War Vet Describes His Scary Russian Roulette Experience

Jason Wilburn served in the Vietnam War and returned home with nightmares and memories of violence that still haunt him. One such incident took place when Jason was playing Russian roulette with a group of his fellow soldiers.

"I remember clearly what happened," says Jason. "I pointed the gun at my head, pulled the trigger...and the gun just clicked."

Russian roulette is a deadly game of chance in which players take turns loading a single bullet into a revolver, spinning the cylinder, and then pulling the trigger. If the player is unlucky enough to point the gun at their head and pull the trigger when the cylinder is lined up with a loaded chamber, they can be killed.

Jason's close call with death left him shaken. "It's just sheer luck that I'm alive today," he says. "I could have easily been killed if the gun had gone off."

Since that frightening experience, Jason has been very careful about handling firearms. "I never want to go through anything like that again," he says.

#  My Life Was in Danger': Vietnam Vet Recalls Playing Russian Roulette

It was March of 1968, and I was a 19-year-old Marine stationed in Vietnam. Like many young men our age, we were testing our limits – doing things we could only imagine before being shipped off to a war zone.

For me, this meant playing Russian roulette.

I would take my pistol out into the jungles near our base and spin the cylinder, pointing it at my head and pulling the trigger. Click. Click. Click.

I remember thinking how easy it would be to just squeeze the trigger and end it all. But I didn't want to die – not yet. I wanted to live through the war and go home to my family.

Looking back, I'm amazed that I made it through alive. So many of my friends didn't make it past their first tour of duty; some didn't even make it out of country alive.

But I was lucky, and when I finally returned home in 1969, I was eager to put that chapter of my life behind me.

It wasn't until years later when I started talking about my experiences in Vietnam that I realized how much that experience had changed me. The horrors of war stayed with me long after I returned home, and for a long time I was struggling with PTSD.

It's been more than 40 years since that fateful year in Vietnam, but the memories still haunt me occasionally. Thankfully those memories don't come as often as they used to, but when they do they're as vivid as if they happened yesterday.

#  Vietnam Veteran Shares Chilling Russian Roulette Story

For 35 years, Vietnam veteran Roger Young kept the story of his harrowing experience during the Vietnam War to himself. He recently decided to share his story with the world in a markdown article on Ghostwriter Central.

Young was stationed in the Mekong Delta in 1969 when he and a group of fellow soldiers were approached by a group of Vietnamese men. The men motioned for the Americans to follow them, and Young and his comrades reluctantly obliged.

The Vietnamese men led the Americans to a small hut, where they were ordered to sit down. One of the men then pulled out a revolver and placed it on the table in front of them. He asked each American if they wanted to play Russian roulette.

Young was terrified, but he didn't want to show any fear in front of his comrades. He also knew that refusing would probably mean death. So he silently took up the offer and put the gun barrel against his head.

Miraculously, he survived the game, but not without suffering some serious injuries. "It was just absolute terror," Young said in an interview with ABC News. "I thought for sure I was going to die."

Despite his terrifying experience, Young doesn't harbor any ill feelings towards the Vietnamese people. "They were just doing what they had to do," he said. "It was survival."
