#  watchdog group warns of online casino trademark class

The International watchdog group, Trademark Owners Against Domain Fraud (TOADF), has issued a warning to online casino and gaming companies to beware of a new class of trademark infringement.

The group says that a number of "brand squatters" have been registering the trademarks of well-known casinos and gaming companies, in an attempt to profit from them.

"This is a new and insidious trend in the world of online casinos and gaming," said TOADF spokesperson, Jameson Woods. "These squatters are registering the trademarks of legitimate businesses and then using them to redirect customers to their own fraudulent websites."

Woods said that his organization has already had success in taking down several of these sites, but that there are many more out there. He urged casino and gaming companies to be vigilant in monitoring their trademarks and to take swift action against any infringement.

A spokesperson for one of the largest online casinos said that the company is well aware of the problem and is taking steps to protect its trademark.

"We're constantly monitoring our trademarks and we'll take swift action against any infringement," said the spokesperson. "We also work with our legal team to pursue any legal remedies available to us."

#  online casino owners speak out against proposed trademark class

U.S. casino owners are speaking out against a proposed trademark class that would include their businesses, claiming it's unfair and will lead to confusion in the marketplace.

The proposal from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) would create a new class for "gambling services" that would include casinos, online gaming, and daily fantasy sports (DFS). While the proposal is still in its early stages, casino industry groups are already speaking out against it.

"It's patently unfair to include casinos in this proposed trademark category," said Gordon Absher, spokesperson for the American Gaming Association (AGA). "The implications are far-reaching and could lead to significant consumer confusion."

Absher added that the AGA is currently meeting with USPTO officials to express their concerns about the proposed class. He said that if the trademark office moves forward with the proposal, it could have a "chilling effect" on casino investment and innovation.

In addition to the AGA, several other casino industry groups have spoken out against the proposal, including the Casino Association of New Jersey (CANJ), which represents Atlantic City's eight casinos.

"This proposed trademark class creates an enormous amount of ambiguity for our members," said CANJ president Tony Rodio in a statement. "It's impossible to know how this will impact our businesses or our employees."

Rodio also criticized attempts by certain DFS operators to "incorporate casino-style games into their platforms," saying that it's an attempt to skirt state gambling laws. He added that DFS is a "completely different product" than traditional casino games, and should not be included in the same trademark class.

#  expert weighs in on online casino trademark class

As a business owner, you want to be sure that the name you choose for your company is legally protected. That's why trademarking your business name is so important. When it comes to online casinos, there are certain classes of trademarks that offer more protection than others.

In general, there are three classes of trademarks:

1. Service marks- These marks identify the services offered by a company.

2. Trademarks- These marks identify the products offered by a company.

3. Collective marks- These marks identify membership in an organization or affiliation with a certain product or service.

The strongest type of trademark is a service mark. This is because service marks specifically identify the services being offered by a company, which can be difficult to replicate. In the online casino industry, this type of trademark is especially important because it can help protect against unauthorized use of the casino's name and logo.

When choosing a trademark for your casino, it's important to make sure that the name is not too similar to any other casinos operating online. You'll also want to make sure that the name is not already trademarked by someone else. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) offers free search tools on their website that can help you determine whether or not a particular name is already trademarked.

If you're looking for extra protection for your online casino, consider registering your trademark with the USPTO. This will give you exclusive rights to use the mark nationwide and will help prevent others from using it without permission.

#  online casino owners react to new trademark class

The news that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has announced a new trademark class specifically for online casinos has been greeted with mixed reactions by the industry.

On the one hand, some operators view the development as an important recognition of the importance of the internet gambling sector, which is now estimated to be worth more than $50 billion a year. They believe that the new trademark class will help to ensure that players have a safe and trustworthy online gaming experience.

On the other hand, others are concerned that the new classification could create confusion among customers, who may not understand the difference between licensed and unlicensed casinos. They also worry that it could lead to more regulation and bureaucratic red tape.



In a statement, William Hill US CEO Joe Asher said: "This is a very positive development for our industry. It shows that US authorities recognize the importance of regulated online gambling, which is now an mainstream form of entertainment."

"It's also good news for consumers," he continued, "as it will help ensure that they can play at licensed and regulated casinos that meet high standards for safety and security."

Caesars Interactive Entertainment CEO Mark Frissora echoed these sentiments, saying: "This is another clear sign from regulators around the globe that Internet gaming is here to stay and is being embraced by governments and gaming companies alike."

However, not everyone in the industry is happy with the new development. PartyGaming Plc CEO Jim Ryan was quoted as saying: "We believe this decision by USPTO amounts to over-regulation of what is a well-functioning industry and creates significant confusion for customers."
